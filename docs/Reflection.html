            The journey of creating my first HTML coded website on two different platforms has been just that to say the least.
            On one hand learning using HTMl coding has been Frustrating yet rewarding, yes it's more difficult but i can say ive learned quite a bit.
            It truly makes you use your problem solving skills. Yes using PSU Wordpress is easier and it kind of does it for you in a way you just kind of pick a theme and colors and copy and paste essentially.
            Although easier to navigate, I find it very rewarding using the HTML coding, I feel as though it would open more doors for you in the long run.
            Also, although frustrating I genuinely enjoyed working through the growing pains of learning HTML, it gets easier with repetition and time put in making the mistakes and learning from them.
            Now while I'm writing this reflection, i'm by no means necessary a pro in HTML coding, just yet at least but i believe with time and consistency i can get there.
